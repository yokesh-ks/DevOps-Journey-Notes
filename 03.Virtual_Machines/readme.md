## 1. What is a server

A server is a computer or system that provides a service to other computers or devices, known as clients, over a network. Servers are typically more powerful and have more storage capacity than client computers, and they are designed to handle a large number of requests and handle them efficiently. There are many different types of servers, each with a specific purpose, such as:

- `File servers`: store and manage files that can be accessed by multiple users over the network.
- `Web servers`: host websites and deliver web pages to clients that request them.
- `Database servers`: store and manage large amounts of data and provide access to it for other applications.
- `Application servers`: run specific applications, such as email or collaboration software, and provide access to them for client devices.
- `Print servers`: manage and distribute print jobs to printers connected to the network.

Servers can be physical computers or virtual machines that run on a host computer. Some servers can also be run on cloud computing platforms, such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.
